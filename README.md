 OneFace

## Attendance Reimagined

### 👎 The Problem  
Manual attendance tracking—especially in college organizations and events—is broken.  
Organizers rely on outdated solutions like Google Forms or pen-and-paper, which are:
- Error-prone  
- Time-consuming  
- Easy to fake or forget  

### ✅ The Solution  
**OneFace** is a seamless, facial recognition-based attendance system.

- Admins create events or classes through our portal  
- Members enroll once, then check in **just by showing up**  
- No QR codes. No tapping screens. No forms.  
- Just walk in—**your face is your check-in**

### 🚀 Why Now  
- Facial recognition is accurate, fast, and affordable  
- Organizations and schools are actively seeking automation  
- Privacy concerns are addressable via opt-in and secure infrastructure  

### 📈 Market Opportunity

- 300K+ student orgs  
- Expands naturally into:
  - Corporate training sessions  
  - Fitness classes  
  - Events and conferences  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
